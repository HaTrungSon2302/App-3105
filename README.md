## What's new in 1.0.1

- **Patch workspace v2** — build patches as a normal bundle-based directory tree under `On My iPhone/Tizi Mod/Patches`; Apply and Export synchronize the workspace automatically.
- **Safer recovery** — original files are journaled before writes; Restore puts existing files back, removes files introduced by the patch, and removes patch-created directories once empty.
- **More capable Files tab** — independent tabs, preserved folder position, multi-selection, ZIP creation and extraction, plus a denser and more consistent grouped layout.
- **Responsive navigation** — iPad split-view and landscape support, optional Cleaner/Wallpaper tabs, stable search fields, and refined icon/row sizing.
- **Wallpaper guidance** — corrected PosterBoard activation steps, including the iOS 27 Collections prerequisite.

See the complete [Patch workspace guide](docs/PATCH_GUIDE.md).

## Highlights

- **App Data Browser** — resolves volatile container UUIDs to stable app bundle identifiers and exposes a native file workspace.
- **File operations** — search, preview, share, import multiple files, copy, move, paste, rename, delete, create files and folders, make ZIP archives, and safely handle name conflicts.
- **Portable `.3105` patches** — bundle-based rules survive container-ID changes between devices; projects may include files or folders, support optional password protection, and can be imported from Files or a secure website link.
- **Limited Cleaner** — scans only each app's `Library/Caches` and `tmp`, sorts recoverable size in either direction, supports bulk selection, and requires confirmation before deletion.
- **Wallpaper Lab** — imports `.tendies` packages, validates payloads, journals installed items, and resets only content installed by Tizi Mod.
- **No jailbreak installation** — Tizi Mod does not install a persistent jailbreak, bootstrap, or daemon and does not inject code into third-party apps. Because it still uses device exploits and can modify app data, no universal guarantee can be made against every app's integrity or jailbreak-detection policy.
- **Localized interface** — English, Vietnamese, and Simplified Chinese.

## Compatibility

Tizi Mod enables device-level features only for builds explicitly verified by the project:

| System | Verified range/builds |
| --- | --- |
| iOS 26 | 26.0 through 26.6.1 |
| iOS 27 Developer Beta 1 | `24A5355q` |
| iOS 27 Developer Beta 2 | `24A5370h` |
| iOS 27 Developer Beta 3 / Public Beta 1 | `24A5380h` |
| iOS 27 Developer Beta 4 / Public Beta 2 | `24A5390f` |

Unlisted iOS 27 builds are marked unsupported rather than assumed compatible.

## Installation notes

- Device functionality requires signing with an **enterprise certificate**.
- SideStore, AltStore, 3uTools, and LiveContainer are not supported installation paths.
- The target bundle identifier is intentionally `com.apple.mobile.MobileHouseArrest`; changing it can break the MHA-C2 app-container workflow.
- The source tree does not contain certificates, provisioning profiles, signed applications, or IPA files; release assets may provide an unsigned IPA.
